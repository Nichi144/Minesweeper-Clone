This is a project I started over the summer to brush up on my Unity skills. It's nothing special, just a clone of Minesweeper, but I hope to someday come back to this project and both spruce it up and make the actual concept of the game more original (since it is a minesweeper clone). Feel free to use it if you need it! Also, for the purposes of the Shovel Jam, this was the first independent game dev project that I didn't do for a class, which I guess captures the "starting out" theme?

Link to the game on GitHub: https://github.com/Nichi144/Minesweeper-Clone/tree/main

Also, for the credits, I'll post a link to the places where I found my assets and got forum for stuff like the generation of the tiles and grid below, if I missed some of the links, sorry about that, this was all I could find that I used from my search history:

RPI's Game Development Club (got some advice from them about a issue I was having with my game) and some of the old notes from my Intro to Game Dev Class

Was partially inspired by this guy's nesting to place part of the stuff I instantiate in overarching containers https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/1bq9xiy/i_was_tired_of_creating_prefab_overrides_by/
